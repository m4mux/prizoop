3/6
Starting point with frame skip 1:						37.9, 46.9% in CPU, 32.0% in render scanline
readByteSpecial moved to switch case:					39.3, 45.2% in PCU, 33.1% in render scanline
forced 256 alignment on memory maps:					no perf diff yet 
moved hram_io to memory map with special case map:		40.9, 43.1% in CPU, 34.3% in render scanline
writeByte moved over to new system:						42.6, 41.3% in CPU, 35.2% in render scanline
w/ O3 and non debug:									no gain! :-D lol
16 buffer lines, 16 cpu steps: 							44.5, 47.6% in CPU, 39.2% in render scanline
8 buffer lines, 16 cpu steps: 							45.5, 47.3% in CPU, 39.5% in render scanline
8 buffer lines, 20 cpu steps: 							46.5, 47.9% in CPU, 40.9% in render scanline
8 buffer lines, 24 cpu steps: 							47.6, 48.3% in CPU, 41.8% in render scanline
1x1 video test:											58.5, 59.6% in CPU, 28.2% in render scanline
buffer lines moved to video ram and DMA					bad! VRAM is slow, need to find different memory address to use? look at other memory spots
buffer copy using int logic								48.7, 48.5% in CPU, 41.2% in render scanline
try DMA from on-chip memory (doesn't work from static)
try 3 color mode?
cpu loop moved to tickDown system:
name and logo :-)

3/5
One piece to the bottom: 				12.0, 54.9 for CPU, 33.3 in render scanline
Faster readShort: 						11.9, 55.4 for CPU, 33.6 in render scanline
Inline CPU stepping:					11.9, 55.1 for CPU, 33.1 in render scanline
Less cpuStep branching:					12.0, 54.7 for CPU, 33.0 in render scanline	
Move vram to on chip:					12.0, 54.8 for CPU, 33.0 in render scanline
sprite optimization:					nothin'
un-roll loops, 02:						14.0, 40.2 for CPU, 42.0 in render scanline
03:										nothin'
all flags work:							14.2, 39.6 for CPU, 40.0 in render scanline
No sprite copy:							15.0, 44.2 for CPU, 37.9 in render scanline
Blit buffer grouped:					15.7, 45.5 for CPU, 35.4 in render scanline
Overclock to 89 MHz:					22.7, similar #'s
Frame skip:								28.4, 24.1 for render scanline
CPU.inl code improvement				27.6
Added 'inline' to cpu functions			29.2
Added back in O3/flto:					28.4
Added support for HALT keyword:			32.0, 47.8 cpu step, 27.3 scanline

Assembly optimization:
Blit scanline buffer condensed until grouped		


Standard DMA 1x1 : 21.7 in render scanline, 58.5 FPS, 59 in cpuStep
DMA using IX : 64.0 FPS, 19.9 in render scanline, 64.8 in cpuStep
